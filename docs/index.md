# Welcome to the Lunali Documentation

## What is Lunali?

Originally Lunali was meant to be a power library for the mod [Lunas Origins](https://modrinth.com/datapack/lunas-origins) but has since become an origin power library aiming to add new powers, conditions, ect. It also aims to backport new features in origin versions above 1.10.1.

You can find official versions of [Lunali](https://modrinth.com/project/lunali) on Modrinth only. Do not download Lunali or any of my other mods off other webites that claim to have them. They are most likely malicious.

If you would like to support the development of Lunali you can join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/pQgEvEYpyq) or donate to my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/lunatico)!
